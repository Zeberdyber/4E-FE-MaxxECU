# 4E-FE-MaxxECU
Toyota 4E-FE 3rd gen base tune for MaxxECU MINI.

Developed on 1998 Corolla EE111 stock engine with 2,5" intake & exhaust, stock collectors.
AEM Wideband gauge connected over CAN.

Tune developed around not the healthiest 4E-FE so take it as base tune only!
Drove with this tune for a year with weather ranging form -15 to +35 deg C.
Slight optimization for fuel efficiency.

Full modification list:
- 2,5" cold intake with cone filter (stock resonator, stock throttle body, stock collector)
- 2,5" exhaust with 200CFM cat, resonator, muffler (stock cast collector: modified to 2,5" V-Band, lambda sensor)
- Power steering throttle body bypass valve delete

Engine has severe blow-by so stock 650RPM idle was tricky for me. Crank case pressure was effecting MAP pressure.
